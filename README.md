AdapSwAGPlugin - an Eclipse plugin for generating adaptive product models from models specified in CVL
====================================================================================================

<h1>1. Introduction </h1>

 In order to support generating the adaptive product model, and the executable code in the adaptive software architecture, we have created an Eclipse
plug-in, called Adaptive Software Architecture Generation tool (AdapSwAG
tool). It consists of three modules to validate resolution models, generate the
adaptive product model from the models specified in the domain engineering,
and executable code from the adaptive product model. These modules are integrated into the Eclipse platform as new menu entities

<h1>2. Installation</h1>
In order to install the plugin, it is simple to copy the jar file in the "pluging" directory into the plugin directory of the Eclipse folder. We have tested with Eclipse Luna 4.4.2.
<h1>3. Utilisation</h1>
<h2> 3.1. Specifying CVL model using EMF Editor </h2>

<h2>3.2. Validating the resolution model </h2> 
The first menu item in the AdapSaWG tools allows openning a window for verifying a resolution model conforming to a variability model.

<h2>3.3. Generating adaptive product model </h2> 

<h2>3.4. Generating partially executable code </h2> 


<h1>4. Example</h1>

In the directory Example, we provide two test collections to vefiry how to the plugin performs.
