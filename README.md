<h1>1. Introduction </h1>

 In order to support generating the adaptive product model, and the executable code in the adaptive software architecture, we have created an Eclipse
plug-in, called Adaptive Software Architecture Generation tool (AdapSwAG
tool). It consists of three modules to validate resolution models, generate the
adaptive product model from the models specified in the domain engineering,
and executable code from the adaptive product model. These modules are integrated into the Eclipse platform as new menu entities
